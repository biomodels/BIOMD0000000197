## Installation

Download this repository, and install with distutils

`python setup.py install`

Or, install using pip

`pip install git+https://github.com/biomodels/BIOMD0000000197.git`

To install a specific version (in this example, from the 2014-09-16 BioModels release)

`pip install git+https://github.com/biomodels/BIOMD0000000197.git@20140916`

## Usage

Importing the model package.

`import BIOMD0000000197 as model`

Get the SBML string from the model

`print model.sbmlString`

If [python-libsbml](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-libsbml) bindings are
installed, the libsbml.SBMLDocument object is also accessible

`model.sbml`

The values for parameters and the inital concentrations of this model where
directly provided by the main author:  
Parameter values parameter | value | unit  
---|---|---  
p1 | 0.0025 | 1/min  
p2 | 0.0784 | 1/min  
p3 | 0.0013 | 1/min  
p4 | 0.0827 | 1/min  
p5 | 0.0091 | 1/min  
p6 | 0.000064 | 1/(nmole*min)  
p7 | 0.0397 | 1/min  
p8 | 1000 | nmole  
p9 | 0.0098 | 1/(nmole*min)  
p10 | 1.6 | 1/min  
p11 | 1000 | nmole  
p12 | 0.0003 | ml/min  
The basal chamber volume was taken as 1 ml, the apical as 1.5. As starting
values x1 was set to 88 nmole, all other species to 0.
